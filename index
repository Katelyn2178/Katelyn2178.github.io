About Me: Katelyn Jefri
</h1>
<p>
My name is Katelyn Jefri, and I am currently 15 years old. I was born and raised in Bridgeport, Connecticut. I have two older brothers, Nick, who is 21 years old, and Edrick, who is 18 years old.
</p>
Ethnicity:
I am a first generation Malaysian-American. From my mother's side, I have Chinese and Javanese descent, along with Indian descent from my father's side.
</p>
<p>
School Background:
I attend an inter-district school called Fairchild Wheeler. It is broken into three individual schools, which each focus on a particular field of study. There is the Biotechnology Research and Zoological Sciences school, the I.T. and Software Engineering school, and the Aerospace and Hydrospace Engineering school.
The branch that I attend is the Aero/Hydro School, where I get to take general engineering courses, along with ones where we learn about the design and physics behind boats and airplanes.
